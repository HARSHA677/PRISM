# Early Detection of Sleep Deprivation: Impact on Cognitive Performance using Deep Learning Techniques

# Problem statement
Examine the changes during sleep deprivation that can provide critical information on the brainâ€™s ability to perform decision-making tasks to reveal significant cognitive consequences.
Understand the variation of ECG, EOG, and EEG signals in non- healthy subjects with respect to healthy subjects.
Identify the distribution statistics of NREM and REM sleep stages of subjects who suffer from diagnosis and other problems using ECG, EOG, and EEG signals.
Analyze the abnormalities in heart rate, and the amount of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen during the episodes and examine how it is associated with cognitive changes.
